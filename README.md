# ☕ Java Internship Projects – CodSoft

Welcome to the official repository of my Java Development Internship at **CodSoft** – a vibrant, student-focused initiative where learning meets practical, hands-on development. This repo contains all the task submissions I’ve completed as part of the internship.

It’s been a solid experience – a blend of traditional learning and modern implementation – and here's where the rubber meets the road. Dive in.

## 📌 About the Internship

**CodSoft** focuses on leadership, collaboration, and self-paced learning. The internship required the completion of a minimum of **three Java-based projects**, ranging from beginner to intermediate levels.

Each task was built from scratch, with clean, readable code, and a strong emphasis on fundamentals. I’ve added optional features wherever possible, because let’s face it – plain vanilla is okay, but a swirl of effort and creativity never hurt anyone.

## 🧠 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1 – Number Guessing Game
> A good ol’ fashioned number guessing game with a modern twist.

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Limited number of attempts
- Instant feedback: too high / too low / bingo
- Multiple round support
- Score tracking system (based on attempts taken)

📁 [Source Code](./NumberGuessGame.java)

### ✅ Task 2 – Student Grade Calculator
> Because grading systems love numbers more than students.

- Input for subject-wise marks
- Calculation of total marks and average percentage
- Grade allocation based on percentage
- Display formatted output to the user

📁 [Source Code](./StudentGradeCalculator.java)

### ✅ Task 3 – ATM Interface
> Basic banking simulation – minus the long queues and paper slips.

- Console-based ATM system
- Supports deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry
- Input validation and clean error handling
- User account management via encapsulated `BankAccount` class

📁 [Source Code](./ATMInterface.java)

## 💼 Optional Add-ons (Coming Soon / WIP)

If time permits and caffeine sustains, I might also push:

- 🔁 A **currency converter** using real-time exchange rates via API
- 🎓 A **student management system** with file I/O or database support

## 🏷️ Tech Stack

- Java (obviously)
- Basic OOP principles
- Clean console UI
- Old-school debugging + modern IDE

---

## 🧩 Lessons Learned

- Writing clean, modular code > writing clever one-liners
- UI/UX is just as important in console-based apps
- The importance of project structuring, validation, and user-centric flow

## ✨ Final Note

This internship was not just about completing tasks. It was about doing them **right**. If you're here reading this and curious about the code or my process, feel free to fork, clone, or just shoot a message my way.

Let’s keep learning, the classic way — by doing.
